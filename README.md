# fourth_year_project

this repository contains the (i) biomass datasets (ii) R codes and (iii) MATLAB codes files that were used in the fourth year project: Addressing the Lack of Mesozooplankton Data in the Global Open Ocean

(i) the biomass datasets consists of two files
- global mesozooplankton biomass raw dataset (standardised across mesh sizes and converted to carbon biomass)
- open ocean mesozooplankton biomass dataset (this is the dataset that was used for the study - dataset also contains the interpolated environmental variables and assigned Longhurst provinces and biomes)

(ii) R code
- code where the R package, LitSearchR, was used for text-mining in order to create a Boolean Search

(iii) MATLAB codes consists of three files
- code for biomass standardisation, mesh standardisation and quality control
- code for the interpolation of environmental variables from WOA18 and VGPM
- code for the statistical analysis conducted in the study
